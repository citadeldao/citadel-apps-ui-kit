# Citadel.one apps UI-Kit

Our set of UI components for efficient use in applications.
Among the components there are standard UI elements like form elements, buttons, tooltips, etc. as well as specific components that use the Citadel.one data structure and the structures of some entities, such as Wallet, used in the existing applications.

â€‹
App UI-Kit is installed in the [base app](https://github.com/citadeldao/ca-base-app) by default, however, if something went wrong you always access it in this repository.
